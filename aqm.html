									<p>In this project, I designed, coded, and 3D printed an air quality monitor using an ESP32 microcontroller, along with the BME680, SGP30, and PMSA003I sensors. The goal of this project was to study the indoor air quality of my home and track how it changes during various activities.</p>

									<p>Understanding the air quality in our living spaces is crucial for our health and well-being. By monitoring air quality, we can gain valuable insights into the effects of everyday activities, such as cooking or cleaning, on the air we breathe. This project allowed me to track trends and identify factors that impact indoor air quality, such as weather conditions and occupancy levels.</p>

									<p>The BME680 sensor played a central role in this project, as it measures temperature, pressure, humidity, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Additionally, the SGP30 sensor provided data on total volatile organic compounds (TVOC) and equivalent CO2 (eCO2) levels. The PMSA003I sensor focused on particulate matter, providing counts and concentrations for PM1.0, PM2.5, and PM10.0 particles.</p>

									<p>To collect data from each sensor, I developed CircuitPython code to interface with the ESP32 microcontroller. The code facilitated communication with an MQTT broker over WiFi and stored the collected data in a database. To visualize and analyze the data, I used Grafana, a powerful data visualization tool. To house all the components, I designed a custom 3D-printed case using CAD software.</p>

									<p>By designing, coding, and 3D printing my own air quality monitor, I was able to gain valuable insights into the indoor air quality of my home. This project allowed me to track trends, identify potential air quality issues, and make informed decisions to create a healthier living environment. </p>

									<p>The PMSA003I particulate matter sensor, manufactured by Plantower, plays a crucial role in measuring air quality by detecting and quantifying the concentration of fine particles in the atmosphere. This sensor employs a laser-based scattering technique to measure particle size and provide real-time data on particulate matter levels, particularly focusing on PM1.0, PM2.5, and PM10.</p>

  									<p>By accurately measuring particle size, the PMSA003I enables the assessment of potential health risks associated with airborne particles - perfect for this project. Fine particles, such as PM2.5, can pose significant health hazards as they can penetrate deep into the respiratory system. Therefore, the sensor's ability to monitor these smaller particles helps in understanding the potential impact on human health in indoor environments.</p>

 									<p>Additionally, the particulate matter concentration data provided by the PMSA003I is invaluable for evaluating overall air quality. High concentrations of particulate matter can indicate the presence of indoor pollution sources, inadequate ventilation, or the infiltration of outdoor pollutants. By continuously monitoring particulate matter levels, the sensor enables timely detection of air quality issues, facilitating appropriate mitigation measures and interventions to improve indoor environments.</p>

  									<p>The PMSA003I particulate matter sensor is designed for integration into air quality monitoring systems, enabling easy data acquisition and analysis. This model by Adafruit features I2C via STEMMA QT, allowing seamless connectivity with microcontrollers or other devices. We will be using this connector to integrate all of the sensors in this build</p>

									<p>The Adafruit SGP30 is an air quality sensor that plays a crucial role in measuring and assessing indoor air quality. While it does not directly measure CO2 levels, it provides an estimation of equivalent carbon dioxide (eCO2) based on VOC (volatile organic compound) levels.</p>
								  
									<p>It is important to note that the Adafruit SGP30 does not directly measure carbon dioxide (CO2) levels. If accurate CO2 measurements are required, specialized sensors designed specifically for CO2 detection could replace this one, but those senors are quite expensive. However, for this application, the estimation of eCO2 provided by the SGP30 is sufficient for assessing general air quality and detecting changes in VOC levels.</p>
								  
									<p>In addition to eCO2, the Adafruit SGP30 also measures Total Volatile Organic Compounds (TVOCs). TVOCs encompass a wide range of organic compounds present in the air, including pollutants and odorous substances, which is vital information to determine the quality of the air.</p>

									<p>The calibration for this sensor is crucial, as it needs at least 12 hours to acquire baseline measurements of eCO2 and TVOC before it can accurately read data from the environment. In the GitHub repository, I have attached the calibration code I used to obtain the baseline measurements.</p>

									<p>The Adafruit BME680 is a highly valuable sensor for measuring air quality (IAQ) as it provides comprehensive data on multiple environmental parameters, including temperature, humidity, pressure, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs).</p>

									<p>One of the key benefits of the BME680 is its ability to measure temperature and humidity accurately. These readings are crucial for understanding the impact of environmental conditions on air quality. Temperature and humidity can affect the behavior of pollutants, chemical reactions, and the overall comfort of indoor spaces. By monitoring these parameters, the BME680 helps identify potential issues such as high humidity levels that may promote mold growth or temperature fluctuations that affect occupant comfort.</p>
								  
									<p>In addition to temperature and humidity, the BME680 measures VOCs, which are emitted by various sources and can impact air quality. However, it's important to note that the BME680's VOC readings may not be as precise as those from specialized VOC sensors like the SGP30. Currently the Bosch BSEC2 library is not available in CircuitPython, which is required to calculate IAQ, so the VOC function is not very useful.</p>
								  
									<p>To obtain more accurate VOC measurements, the BME680's temperature and humidity readings can be used in combination with the Adafruit SGP30 air quality sensor. By feeding the temperature and humidity data from the BME680 into the SGP30, the VOC readings can be compensated and calibrated for improved accuracy. This allows for a more reliable assessment of air quality, taking into account the influence of environmental conditions.</p>
								  
									<!-- <p>The combination of the BME680 and SGP30 sensors provides a more comprehensive picture of indoor air quality, incorporating temperature, humidity, and VOC measurements. This allows users to monitor and analyze IAQ parameters collectively, making informed decisions to improve the overall air quality and create healthier living or working environments.</p> -->
