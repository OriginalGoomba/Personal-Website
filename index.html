            Hello, my name is Dillon Kelley, and I am young Mechanical Engineer
            at Kiewit. I am a hardworking, self-starting, and detail-oriented
            engineer with a passion for purposeful innovation. I am always
            looking for a challenging opportunity to further grow my skills in
            engineering and computer science. This website serves as a vessel
            for my personal projects and hobbies, which I invite you to explore within the site.
          </p>
          <p>
            At Kiewit Corporation, I work as an Engineer for the WMATA Yellow
            Line Tunnel Rehabilitation Project in Washington, DC. My
            responsibilities includ leading the planning, execution, and
            progress tracking of tunnel steel repairs and bolting operations. I
            also developed innovative methods for bolt replacement to improve
            worker efficiency, reduce project cost, and advance the project
            schedule.
          </p>
          <p>
			As a Research Assistant at the University of Mississippi, I
            investigated alternative viable plastics for transmission solenoids
            in GM vehicles. Our team's recommendation was approved by GM based
            on the data collected and analyzed. I also instructed colleagues on
            high-speed filming equipment and lighting, as well as the safe use
            of testing equipment. 
          </p>
          <p>
            For my Senior Capstone Design project, I designed and manufactured a
            working prototype for an on-campus electric bike retrieval and
            storage stand. I utilized PTC Creo, GD&amp;T, and microcontroller
            programming to successfully assemble a working prototype for further
            development by the university.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some of my skills include proficiency in Creo Parametric, Autodesk
            Fusion 360, MATLAB, Python, Java, C++, and ANSYS Fluent. I also have
            experience with 3D printing, lathes, mills, microcontrollers, PLCs,
            and oscilloscopes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thank you for taking the time to learn a little more about me. I
            look forward to the opportunity to bring my skills and passion to a
            new challenge in the energy industry.
          </p>
