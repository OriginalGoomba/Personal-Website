								<p>	This weather station uses two ESP-32 microcontrollers to wirelessly communicte using the ESP-NOW communication protocol. 
									Weather data from a DHT-11 humidity sensor and BMP180 temperature and pressure sensor collect data inside a radiation shield that I 3D
									modeled. This data is taken at a preprogrammed intervals from these sensors to the ESP-32 to be sent to the reciever inside for display on a small 
									screen meant for a desk. The design also implements a rain sensor and tipping bucket rain gauge as a seperate module that I had lying around as spare 
									parts from an old weather station. In the future, it would be nice to add more functionality with an anemometer to collect windspeed data. Another idea I would 
									like to implement in the future is data logging on an MQTT server using a raspberry pi server that talks to all my electronics projects. This would be 
									useful to track the climate over time at the residence, while comparing it to measurements from the local municipality. All the materials are purchased, 
									but since the semester has started, finding free time to work on hobbies will be hard to come by.

									Both iterations of the radiation shield were modeled using Creo Parametric 6.0. I originally designed a square box with louvers surrounding each side and a basic slanted roof. 
									Although this design was simple to design and featured integrated circuit board mounting and an inlay for a solar panel, the design was not very element proof. After two days of weather testing, 
									it was clear the design let too much rain inside the housing which could damage the more sensitive components of the weather station. After the failure 
									of this design, I researched commercial weather station radiation shields and came across the "stevenson" radiation shield, which is a round cylindical structure 
									with louvers wrapping all around. I also took note that they were all white as to not absorb excess solar radiation that could throw off measurements. 
									<span class="image left"><img src="\images\Weather_Station_2021\squareIMG_6881.jpg" alt="" /></span>I tried 
									to find a 3D printable design online, but every design posted had its own set of problems that seemed to make them unattractive to print. Most of these preexisting models 
									used large metal shafts or intricate post print assembly. So, I just made my own fully 3D printable radiation shield, except for a few M3 and M4 nuts and bolts. 
									It is designed to accomodate a 25 millimeter wide circuit board, with integrated cable passthrough inside the support shaft.

									This 
									
									This is the shaft part I designed in Fusion360. Much like the trigger part above, the precise measurements were adhered to strictly, while once again liberties were taken to aid in rigidity and ease of 3D printing. The location for the original reed switch magnet has been projected perfectly with respect to the shaft so that there is no misalignment through the full range of motion. The angle of the keyway that couples with the trigger part is also modeled perfectly for a snug fit. The bottom has been reinforced for 3D printing ease. Extra strength in this area can help provide a solid wide base to 3d print a vertical shaft on.</p>
